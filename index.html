							# Waterfall

							Everything planned out ahead of time, and executed in a procedural step-by-step process. Change was disruptive and _change management_ was difficult at best.

							# Agile

							The antithesis of Waterfall. <br>_adjective_ **able to move quickly and easily.** <br>That's it, nothing more.

							And please note, Agile is a theoretical definition of product management. Neither a framework nor specific process.

							See [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/).

							# SCRUM

							A practice of Agile. A defined body of work that will be delivered within the scope of a sprint (anywhere between a week and a month). Name was taken from Rugby.

							__The team acts as one unit to deliver__

					<section data-markdown>

							# Kanban

							A practice of Agile. Initially a scheduling system for lean production and 'just-in-time' manufacturing. Adopted as a 'just-in-time' software delivery model.

						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## SCRUM: locks in a Sprint<br>and work is committed to

							There are specific rules of engagement. Short work cycles, or sprints, allow for work flexibility. There is little to no flexibility within the scope of the sprint to alter work items to be delivered.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Kanban: more fluid time frame, work is pulled from a prioritized backlog

							Work is fed from a groomed backlog. The goal of a sprint is to maintain a flow of new work as work is completed. What comes next is fluid based on the always flexible and prioritized backlog.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## SCRUM: change management inside a sprint

							Nope. If the scope of a story changes within the sprint, that work is ejected and recycled for an upcoming sprint. Depending on the scope of your sprint, that could push off work anywhere from a week to a month.
						</script>
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						<script type="text/template">
							## Kanban: change management within a 'time box'

							Kanban is more focused on the work being done, not the work that was committed to. Backlog is always re-prioritized giving a lot of flexibility to what work will be done next without committing to a sprint.

								<li class="fragment fade-up">

								<li class="fragment fade-up">
									Fibonacci numbers (1,2,3,5,8) are common, t-shirt sizing(S,M,L) is preferred
								</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">
									If scope is undetermined || dependencies are not met, story CANNOT be estimated or 'pulled'
								</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">
									Planning estimate is 'best guess'
								</li>
								<li class="fragment fade-up">
									Final estimate is agreed upon once work is pulled
