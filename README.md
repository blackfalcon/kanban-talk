# Kanban in the enterprise

### Roles, responsibilities and delivery

A slide deck built in reveal.js to discuss the importance of and difference between agile methodologies such as Kanban and SCRUM.


## Build and review deck

Now, I could export a [PDF and put this deck somewhere](http://www.anotheruiguy.com/talks/kanban/), but how is that any fun? Also, if you are new to coding, reveal.js is really easy and an amazing intro to coding. By following some simple steps, you will be that much smarter :)
